# OnlineTestApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.0.


DESCRIPTION

The Online Test Application system creates an application that enables users to provide online tests, review them, and display the results.

System Details
This system contains three main modules: Quiz, Review, and Result. The quiz section of the online test application accepts the questions in JSON format. The JSON file can be easily shared from the server in the pre-defined format. The application renders the test at the client-side.
The “Review and display result” section allows users to declare the results immediately. You can simply call another JSON with the answers in it and evaluate and display the results immediately.

To download dependencies

sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
